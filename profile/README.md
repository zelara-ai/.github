# Zelara

**One app that adapts to how you live.** 🌱

Start simple. Unlock features as you progress. Improve your life. Support sustainability.

---

## 🌍 Our Vision

Traditional green initiatives feel disconnected—no sense of progress. We're changing that.

**Zelara** helps you organize your life (finances, productivity, home) while contributing to green causes. Like a skill tree for real personal growth.

**Not for profit.** No cloud servers. Fully on-edge. Your data stays on your device.

As you benefit from the app, you support green initiatives—through optional donations, marketplace profits, or partnerships.

## ✨ How It Works

### 1️⃣ Start with Basics
- ♻️ **Recycling validation**: Use paper bags, verify with photos (processed on your device)
- 💰 **Expense tracking**: Log spending, build financial awareness

### 2️⃣ Earn Points & Unlock Features
- Complete verified tasks → earn points
- Points unlock advanced modules based on your lifestyle

### 3️⃣ Choose Your Path

**💼 Finance Module**
Organize personal or business finances. Track expenses, prepare taxes, manage budgets.
→ **Green impact**: Optional donation suggestions from excess funds

**⚡ Productivity Module**
Focus tools, calendar/email AI, task management.
→ **Green impact**: Buy themed skins/accessories—all profits fund green initiatives

**🏡 Homeowner Module**
City apartment? Suburban house? Rural farm? Get personalized pathways to reduce your carbon footprint.
→ **Green impact**: Research solar panels, insulation, transportation alternatives. Partner referrals fund green causes.

### 4️⃣ Your Devices Work Together
Heavy processing (image validation, complex calculations) runs on your most capable device:
- 🖥️ **Desktop** (highest compute)
- 📱 **Mobile** (camera, daily tasks)
- 🌐 **Web** (lightweight access)

Devices link together. No cloud needed.

## 🌿 Green Initiatives

**We're not greenwashing.** Here's how it works:

- **Finance users**: App suggests optional donations from excess funds (you control the amount)
- **Productivity users**: Profits from themed skins/accessories go directly to green causes
- **Homeowner users**: Partner referrals (solar installers, etc.) fund sustainability projects

**100% transparent.** All transactions and donations publicly tracked.

## 🛠️ Technology

- ✅ **Client-side**: Runs on your device, not cloud servers
- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Desktop (Windows/Mac/Linux), Mobile (iOS/Android), Web
- ✅ **Privacy-first**: Data stays on your device. Optional sync across your own devices only.
- ✅ **Open source**: All code publicly available
- ✅ **AI-coordinated**: Claude and AI assistants help develop under human oversight
